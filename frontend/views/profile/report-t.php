You are good at taking quick decisions when a situation asks for that and you enjoy fast pace. You know how to be persuasive and take strategic action. You can be enthusiastic and have a tendency to be impatient when things are going slow or goals aren’t reached as fast as you want. Your ambition will get you far and you won’t accept borders when they are blocking the goals to be reached. You enjoy winning.

                    <p>Air driven people tend to think things through and analyze, look at the big picture and keep a helicopter view on things. They have an investigating attitude and open mind and are therefore capable to come up with new solutions for problems. They are likely to take their time to discover links between things and look at a problem from different angles to understand how it works. They will take action after they have analyzed and thought about how to solve a specific problem. They can be flexible and open for change, curious, creative, and tend to be critical and tolerant to the ideas of other people.</p>

They are action oriented and enjoy finishing what they have started or finish what others have started. They like things to be reliable and order things for that purpose. Order, structure and discipline helps them to do their work the way they think it should be done or the way they think others expect them to do it. They prefer a pragmatic approach, like to find and seek practical solutions, have patience, and they like facts and figures.

            Drivers are powerful sources of energy that we rely on and that make you feel in your element. We all use the 4 drivers, but not in the same way: we tend to have a “preferred” driver, which we use most in our daily chores and in moments of difficulty. On the graph in your profile page you can read how much you tend to use each of them.
            </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Your first driver is Fire: The power of decision.</span>
            You take initiative and keep your focus on reaching goals. You will try to influence others in reaching these and dare to take risks while doing so. You are good at taking quick decisions when a situation asks for that and you enjoy fast pace. You know how to be persuasive and take strategic action. You can be enthusiastic and tend to be impatient when things are going slow. Your ambition will get you far and you won’t accept limitations when they are blocking the goals to be reached. You enjoy winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">What gives you ENERGY & what DISENGAGES you.</span>
            You like to be challenged in your work environment. Some competition is no problem for you, as you enjoy performing to reach challenging objectives. A fast pace work environment, where you are in the position to make decisions and influence others will give you energy.

            <p><span class="bold">Understand your Drivers.</span>
            Drivers are powerful sources of energy that we rely on and that make you feel in your element. We all use the 4 drivers, but not in the same way: we tend to have a “preferred” driver, which we use most in our daily chores and in moments of difficulty. On the graph in your profile page you can read how much you tend to use each of them.

            <span class="bold">Your first driver is Earth: The power of Action.</span>
            You like to structure things and have a preference for clear procedures. You are action oriented and enjoy finishing what you or others have started. You appreciate reliability and bring order for that purpose. Precision, structure and discipline help you to do your work the way you think it should be done or is expected from you. You prefer a pragmatic approach, like to find and seek practical solutions, and you like facts and figures.  You are normally patient and create clarity by ordering information, sometimes overly careful. Your perseverance and discipline bring practical results, also to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">What gives you ENERGY & what DISENGAGES you.</span>
            You like a structured working environment with clear instructions, systems. It is important for you to deliver on your agreements and you expect others to do likewise. You enjoy task oriented assignments. Getting things done is your slogan, therefore you do not feel happy at work when people don’t finish their tasks.

You are sensitive to feelings and pay attention to the opinions of others. You like to connect with other people and therefore you are usually a good networker. You actively strive for consensus in making decisions, and you foster team spirit. You show empathy and offer help to others when needed. You can be understanding, a good listener, cooperative, with a friendly attitude, and tend to avoid conflict. Your focus is on the other person and on the group, so sometimes you need to be more assertive for yourself.

            Drivers are powerful sources of energy that we rely on and that make you feel in your element. We all use the 4 drivers, but not in the same way: we tend to have a “preferred” driver, which we use most in our daily chores and in moments of difficulty. On the graph in your profile page you can read how much you tend to use each of them.

            <span class="bold">Your first driver is AIR: The power of Thought.</span>
            You like to analyse and think things through, look at the big picture and keep a helicopter view. You have an investigating attitude with an open mind and you are capable to come up with new solutions. You take your time to discover links between things and look at a problem from different angles to deepen your understanding. You will take action after you have examined all aspects of a situation. You can be flexible, curious, creative, you tend to be tolerant to the ideas of other people but also critical.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">What gives you ENERGY & what DISENGAGES you.</span>
            You flourish in working situations where you can brainstorm and think out of the box. You want to have autonomy in your work and not to feel restricted in your thought and action. With this personal freedom you will get the best out of yourself.

You prefer a pragmatic approach, like to find and seek practical solutions, and you like facts and figures.

            You are sociable and keep your focus on harmony in the group. You like to collaborate with others, are accommodating and respectful. You are sensitive to feelings and pay attention to the opinions of others. You like to connect with other people and therefore you are usually a good networker. You actively strive for consensus in making decisions, and you foster team spirit. You show empathy and offer help to others when needed. You can be understanding, a good listener, cooperative, with a friendly attitude, and tend to avoid conflict. Your focus is on the other person and on the group, so sometimes you need to be more assertive for yourself.

On the graph in your profile page you can read how much you tend to use each of them.
